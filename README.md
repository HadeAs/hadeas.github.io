This template is perfect for those who want to use Tailwind CSS and Astro to build a blog. 

It is inspired by the [Tailwind Next.js Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) - one of the most popular Next.js blogging templates.

Even thought these features looks the same as the original template, they are implemented in a different way, and there are more to come.

However, there are some features that are not in the original template, like:

- Support for multiple authors pages - **each author will have** its own page, with a list of all the posts written by him/her.
- Support for multiple tags pages - **each tag has its own page with custom description**, that can be customized with markdown. 
- Related posts - **each post has** a list of related posts, provided by the author inside the markdown file.
- Pagination inside blog/tags pages - **each blog/tags page has** a pagination.
- Cool animations provided by Astro.
- And many more that would come in the future.

## Extend / Customize

`src/consts.ts` contains a list of constants that you can customize to your liking, including the blog title, description, author, social media links, etc.

`src/functions.ts` contains a list of functions that changes the default behavior of the template, including default post sorting and exclude draft posts.

`src/content/authors/default.mdx` contains the default author information. You can add more authors by adding more `.mdx` files in the `src/content/authors` folder.

`src/content/tags/default.mdx` contains the default tag information. You can add more tags by adding more `.mdx` files in the `src/content/tags` folder.
